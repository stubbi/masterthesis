abstract = {The computational power of massively parallel networks of simple processing elements resides in the communication bandwidth provided by the hardware connections between elements. These connections can allow a significant fraction of the knowledge of the system to be applied to an instance of a problem in a very short time. One kind of computation for which massively parallel networks appear to be well suited is large constraint satisfaction searches, but to use the connections efficiently two conditions must be met: First, a search technique that is suitable for parallel networks must be found. Second, there must be some way of choosing internal representations which allow the preexisting hardware connections to be used efficiently for encoding the constraints in the domain being searched. We describe a general parallel search method, based on statistical mechanics, and we show how it leads to a general learning rule for modifying the connection strengths so as to incorporate knowledge about a task domain in an efficient way. We describe some simple examples in which the learning algorithm creates internal representations that are demonstrably the most efficient way of using the preexisting connectivity structure.},

  abstract = {Gradient descent optimization algorithms, while increasingly popular, are
often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their
strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the
reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms
that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look
at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the
most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and
distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing
gradient descent.},
