\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would first like to express my gratitude to my supervisor 
Jun. Prof. Dr. Sevag Gharibian who guided me through this 
thesis. His door was always open for discussions on the topic. 
He allowed this thesis to be my own work, and steered me into the right direction
whenever needed. He introduced me to experts in the field and made it possible 
for me to discuss my ideas with them.

Secondly, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Eyke H{\"u}llermeier, who 
helped me figuring out how to generate a balanced set of training samples.

Further, I want to thank Norbert Schuch, who helped me to understand the neat 
mathematical tricks in the original papers about NQS. I am grateful for Ronald de Wolf who 
took the time to discuss the underlying ideas with Sevag and me. 
Johannes Pausch proposed ideas to resolve some of the initial obstacles
in making the simulations work. Robert Schade was of big help in setting 
up the experiments on the Noctua Cluster.

Additionally, I want to thank Lisa Clau{\ss}en, Nahuel Miranda, Dorian Rudolph, Harry Duwe,
and Lisanne Visser for proof-reading. Last but not least, I want to thank my family 
and Lisanne for providing emotional support throughout the course of this thesis.
