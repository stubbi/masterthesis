\chapter{Random Circuit Sampling}

Despite four decades
of research in this field, 
there was no real proof whether it would be possible to build quantum computers
which are truly more powerful than classical competers. This only changed
recently, when Google announced the results of their quantum supremacy
experiments on a 54 qubit quantum computer. To demonstrate the supremacy, they
chose the problem of random circuit sampling which has been specically tailored
to this purpose.
